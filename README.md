# Imedisoft

Imedisoft is an evolving fork of [OpenDental](https://github.com/OpenDental/opendental), 
currently in development, with the goal of refactoring the codebase and aligning 
it with the latest .NET coding standards.

## Key Changes

### Streamlined Integrations

Several external service integrations have been removed due to their reliance on a 
proprietary, closed-source library. The following integrations have been removed:

- CareCredit
- PostcardMania
- QuickBooks Online
- OAuth for Outlook
